/* This Code has been create by: Randol 
While this is a valid way to access the object's property, there is a pitfall here. 
If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. 
In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.

this is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it. In the current context, this refers to the object that the method is associated with: duck. 
If the object's name is changed to mallard, it is not necessary to find all the references to duck in the code. It makes the code reusable and easier to read.
